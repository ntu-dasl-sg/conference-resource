`Conventional methods of assessing future climate risks are focused on the volume of assets potentially lost to a disaster. However, future climate risk stands at the intersection of several complex systems. This means that climate-induced hazards and extremes might have non-linear impacts on different communities, which are not only due climatic drivers but the inherent complexities of the socioeconomic system. While asset-based metrics are important for providing an overview of immediate physical losses, they fail to fully capture the disparate impacts on different social groups and the knock-on impacts that people continue to experience post-disaster. For instance, relying on asset-based metrics alone could lead to climate adaptation decisions that prioritise the protection of asset-rich areas as they seemingly have more at risk. In doing so, it obscures the protection needs of asset-poor regions, and in extreme cases, could further exacerbate impacts and issues of inequity. This study uses a combination of a probabilistic coastal flood hazard model generated from millions of extreme event simulations, with a direct consequence model, to identify physical (asset) damages from coastal flooding in the Manila Bay area. We then use an adaptive economic model which investigates how individual household consumption is impacted, and how they recover such that well-being losses are minimised. We find that the same physical hazard can have vastly different impacts on household well-being, and this can therefore serve to better inform climate policies and target them to the most vulnerable.

`Coastal communities are expected to be highly exposed to rising sea levels and more frequent and intense tropical storms in the coming decades, with forced migration (or displacement) highly likely in many of these places. The exposure to these hazards is driven not just by climate change, but also by growing populations and rapid urbanisation of coastal cities. However, the extent of forced migration will be highly variable, and will be dependent on pre-existing physical and social vulnerabilities present in each location. Therefore, in order to reliably forecast future forced migration due to sea-level rise and tropical storms, it is necessary to construct spatially explicit displacement curves that link hazard levels to the migratory response of communities. This study has calibrated displacement curves through regression analysis for the Philippines based on historical internal migratory movements due to coastal flooding and tropical storms. The data for calibration was obtained from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre and governmental disaster reports, and the calibration was performed at the level 3 administrative boundaries. With the displacement curves, critical thresholds of flood and wind damage, at which point forced migration occurs, are identified. Subsequently, these displacement curves are combined with projections of future sea-levels and tropical storms in order to forecast the forced migration of communities under climate change. The displacement curves can be used by researchers, planners and policymakers to understand the varied migratory response of communities to sea-level rise and its associated hazards. This will allow for effective adaptation plans to be devised in advance in order to manage such forced migration in a manner that allows communities, including vulnerable ones, to relocate and avoid the adverse impacts of a changing climate.

`Traditional flood risk assessments operate under the implicit assumption that all damage will be repaired. While this assumption holds true for the vast majority of cases, it becomes questionable in instances of highly frequent or even perpetual flooding. In such scenarios, the cost of repeated damage repairs may far surpass the benefits of continued habitation. This issue becomes more pronounced when forecasting future climate scenarios predicated on a 'no adaptation measures' assumption, often evaluated to discern the potential benefits of adaptation. Building on principles of financial theory, we propose a practical approach that factors in instances where damage repair becomes economically unfeasible, and the building is consequently abandoned. This theory was applied to a comprehensive coastal flood risk assessment across Southeast Asia under projected climate change conditions. We discovered substantial disparities between the conventional assumption of universal damage repair and the alternative scenario where buildings beyond economic repair are abandoned. Our findings suggest that the ubiquitous damage repair assumption can lead to significant inaccuracies. Therefore, we recommend adopting our straightforward approach to account for unrealistic continual repair. This adjustment is especially crucial in flood risk assessments that incorporate the impact of climate change.

`Modeling frameworks that merge the imperfect knowledge derived from observed data with that of process-based models have supported our understanding of earth, environment, and hazards processes. Inversion methods enable the calibration of parameters that cannot be directly measured, while forward estimation gives us the modeled response of the system based on calibrated parameters. In this study, we demonstrate methodological improvements in the inversion and forward estimation modeling processes when using limited, uncertain and spatial data. In the inversion setting, we place attention on the choice of the cost function to define the best fit between modeled output and observations. This modeling choice receives little attention but has a significant impact on the results. We also demonstrate the use of data-weighting in the inversion process to account for the differential uncertainty in data. In the forward estimation, we propose to combine the forward modeled output with measured data using spatial statistical techniques. As a test case, we implement the framework on a tephra dispersion model using thickness observations of varying uncertainty to reconstruct past volcanic eruption characteristics and associated tephra fallout. The results show consistent improvements in model predictive performance for both inversion and forward models.

`The development of more dynamic and future-focused approaches in modeling the hazard-related risk of urban environments has been fundamental in the field of disaster risk management, supporting proactive policy decisions. However, recent methods that calculate large-scale urban risk have primarily focused on time-dependent hazards and exposure, lacking emphasis on time-dependent vulnerability. In this study, we present a computational model that predicts future urban risk while accounting for spatio-temporal variations in physical vulnerability and exposure. The framework is used to simulate the future risk from climate hazards of physical infrastructures in a large-scale region in the Philippines. To simulate exposure change, we use SLEUTH-GA, a cellular automata-based urban growth model that utilizes genetic algorithms for calibration, along with Java Spatial Model, an urban growth model capable of simulating future population and built-up area sensitive to socio-economic and zoning scenarios. To model the change in physical vulnerability, we developed a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain simulation approach. The applications consider policy interventions that influence both exposure and vulnerability: (1) discouraging future urban growth on hazard-prone areas (2) driving different economic growth rates, and (3) varying rates and design standards for large-scale building improvements. The impact quantification is time-dependent and focuses on physical impact metrics such as structural or content damage. The framework can further be utilized to consider non-asset based losses. Ultimately, this work underlines the significance of time-dependent risk models in understanding hazard-related risk in urban environments over the lifespan of its infrastructures.
